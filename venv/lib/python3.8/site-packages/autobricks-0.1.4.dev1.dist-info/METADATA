# What the heck is this?

It's a high level wrapper around the Databricks API so that we can write simple short expressive python scripts in CI/CD pipelines to deploy databricks bits and peices. Also use adhocly if you wish.

# The Docs are here

Many operations mimick the API but there's also some handy high level handling for common operations.
